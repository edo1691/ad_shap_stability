# Stability Index for Local Interpretability in Machine Learning

This project is focused on unsupervised models to identify anomalies in financial scenarios. Our approach not only enhances model performance but also ensures robust interpretability by integrating advanced machine learning techniques with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, fostering greater trust in the model's predictions.

## Key Features

* **Stability Index for Local Interpretability**: Introducing a new stability measure that quantifies the consistency of the model in ranking important features under data perturbations, crucial for building user trust.
* **Explainable AI (XAI) Models**: Enhancing transparency and understanding of model decisions through SHAP values.
* **Unsupervised Machine Learning**: Utilizing techniques like Isolation Forest for anomaly detection, crucial in identifying high-risk clients.
* **Robust Anomaly Detection**: Ensuring reliable and consistent predictions even under varying conditions.
